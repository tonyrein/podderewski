# podderewski
Yet another automated podcast grabber

Why another automated podcast grabber? After all, we already have mashpodder, bashpodder, greg, and gpo (the command-line program bundled with GPodder). Two reasons: 1) It's good practice for me, an opportunity to learn more Python and get better at figuring out how the pieces of an application fit together; and 2) None of the others I've checked out do exactly what I need, although some come pretty close.

What podderewski is designed to do:
1. Maintain a list of "subscribed" podcasts

2. For each podcast, keep track of which episodes have been downloaded 

3. Be run without a UI, probably from a cron job.

4. Allow downloading of all episodes, or only new episodes, or a specified number of episodes
